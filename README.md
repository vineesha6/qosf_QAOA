Submission of screening task 1 for QOSF mentorship program, September 2020

Quantum Machine Learning using Pennylane
-> Building a four-qubit quantum circuit(QAOA embedding) with number of layers(L) as an input parameter.
-> Optimizing circuit parameters to minimize the norm distance between the circuit computed state vector and a random four-qubit state vector.
-> Finding correlation between L and the minimum distance
